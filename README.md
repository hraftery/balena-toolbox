# balena-toolbox

A very simple, but oh-so-useful balena app that can be added to any device to provide a standard set of Linux tools for working with balenaOS.

Examples of tools: jq, dtc, vim, libgpiod, plus the machinery to support them and the workshop to wield them. See `Dockerfile` for full list.
